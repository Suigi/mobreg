## Ensemble Timer-related

* Ensemble Session: when an Ensemble is in progress, this is the "Session". It has a set of Participants, and an associated Timer (EnsembleTimer).
* Turn: the period of time when participants are in a single role, typically lasts 3-5 minutes (aka "Rotation")
* Rotation Timer: counts down the amount of time remaining in a rotation
* Rotate: everyone switches roles as defined in the ensemble (Driver becomes Navigator, etc.)
