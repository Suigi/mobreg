    - Integrate with GitHub for adding collaborators to the repo
    - Integrate with Calendars (both theirs and mine) via Google API and then ?? based on demand

      - As a bot, helping with self-service sign-up

# Registration Scenarios

## Member to Huddle Registration

Someone who has participated in past Huddles wants to register for a future huddle.

1. Show sign-up/sign-in page

2. User clicks on "Sign In via GitHub" and flow completes successfully. If it fails, redirect to error or "try again" page of some sort.

3. If they are **not** a ROLE_MEMBER, then redirect them to User "Home Page" (placeholder for now), otherwise continue...

4. Display list of Huddles, each having REGISTER buttons (if capacity limit hasn't been reached)

5. Member clicks on REGISTER button

6. Call HuddleService.register with info from Member. 


## User to Member

This scenario needs more analysis.

1. Unknown person hits home page, presented with "Login via GitHub" or "Become a Member"
2. If they choose Login via GitHub, then redirect to OAuth web flow
