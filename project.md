# MobReg

This project manages Remote Learning Ensemble (Mob Programming) huddles (huddles are a specific, scheduled learning session).

# Features To-Do

* Rename domain term: Huddle -> Ensemble

    + Ensembles belong to a group

* Members
    + Members can belong to Zero or more groups
    + Tiers

* Provide calendar invites using links
    - Provide WorldTimeBuddy.com links for huddles (maybe not needed if calendar links are sufficient)
  
* Integrate with Zoom to create a meeting each time a Huddle is scheduled
    - See https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/native-sdks/developer-accounts and https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/meetings/meetingcreate



    - Integrate with GitHub for adding collaborators to the repo
    - Integrate with Calendars (both theirs and mine) via Google API and then ?? based on demand
        + Until then, provide a field to be manually entered so that it can be added as part of the calendar invites, messages to participants, as well as serving as a reminder to create the meeting in Zoom
    - As a bot, helping with self-service sign-up
    v "Integrate" with MobTi.me -- via WebSocket [blocked]

* Member Registration
    + Collect info for participants
    + Store a link to the video recording, only available to those who were participants of that Huddle
    + Limit registration to 5 per huddle in UI

## Member to Huddle Registration

DONE except for optional (constraint) parts

Someone who has participated in past Huddles wants to register for a future huddle.

1. Show sign-up/sign-in page

2. User clicks on "Sign In via GitHub" and flow completes successfully. If it fails, redirect to error or "try again" page of some sort.

3. If they are **not** a ROLE_MEMBER, then redirect them to User "Home Page" (placeholder for now), otherwise continue...

4. Display list of (optional: available) Huddles, each having REGISTER buttons

    * (optional) if capacity limit hasn't been reached, otherwise we'll check later

5. Member clicks on REGISTER button

6. Call HuddleService.register with info from Member. 


## User to Member

This scenario needs more analysis.

1. Unknown person hits home page, presented with "Login via GitHub" or "Become a Member"
2. If they choose Login via GitHub, then redirect to OAuth web flow
